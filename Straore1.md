My name is Sekou Traore and I am a first year course-only Masters student in Computer Science.
I am interested in software security or more specifically ways to improve user interaction patterns that can increase risks,however I remain open to other exciting possibilities for my project.
I hope that this class will help me deepen my understanding of the software engineering process in order to have a more flexible toolset that can be applied towards a variety of disciplines.
